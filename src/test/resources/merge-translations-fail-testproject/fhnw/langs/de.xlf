                    &lt;p&gt;Configure the company size defining the number of employees. You can adapt the number, for example as your company grows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The size of the company affects your needs for cybersecurity practices. For example, a medium-sized company will benefit from company-internal cybersecurity expertise and dedicated budgeting. A small company benefits more from outsourcing of such specialty expertise. CYSEC will adapt its recommendations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Document the headcount (number of people) and not the full-time-equivalent. For example, a company with 10 employee working with a 60% contract should state 10 and not 6. Also, do count special roles such as the CEO as an employee.&lt;/p&gt;</source>
